# Text Encryption Using Cryptographic Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project is a simple web-based application that allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text using cryptographic techniques. The application uses AES encryption along with a random Initialization Vector (IV) and salt to ensure that identical inputs produce different encrypted outputs.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to understand the basics of symmetric encryption and how cryptography is used to secure data.

## Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
CryptoJS Library

## Features
Encrypt user text securely
Decrypt encrypted text
Random salt generation
Random IV generation
Password-based encryption
Simple and user-friendly interface

## How It Works
1. The user enters text and a secret key.
2. The system generates a random salt and IV.
3. AES encryption is applied to the text.
4. The encrypted output is displayed.
5. The same key is used to decrypt the text.

## Learning Outcomes
Understanding symmetric encryption
Working with IV and salt
Implementing cryptography in web applications
Basic security practices
